Project Notes:
------------------

The project is typical of a routine project for me in many ways. The project features:

- HTML5/SCSS/JS
- Use of the revealing module pattern
- Advanced jQuery concepts designed for performance, such as reference caching, method chaining, and use of the find method
- Node.js + Restify as the web server
- Grunt as the process runner
- Build process featuring automatic compilation of SCSS as well as concatenation and minification of all JS/CSS
- Inline commenting in JSDoc compilable format
- Unit testing with Mocha/Chai
